This auduino sketch has been written to excercise the various pieces
of hardware on the MobSenDat board. As the entire board doesn't need
to be populated, this software has been written to support the case
where boards are only partially populated.

The configure the software for your particular board configuration,
edit the file 'selftest_config.h' and comment out the lines enabling
the features that you don't have.

By default, all hardware features are enabled, which describes a fully
populated board.
